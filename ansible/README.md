# Ansible automation
This ansible script is for initialising fresh Kali installation with some tools

Usage: `ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass`
then give password. You should create your own vault.yml file where you put your secrets

I will create roles later, so it is easier to leave some installations out if not needed

## Prerequisites
- ansible
